# 1Brc-challenge
This is my attempt to do the 1BRC challenge in C++. The original repo of this challenge is here: https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc/tree/main
The current implementation of multi-threading is the use of std::future together with std::async. As the next step a future version of the implementation will be based on C++ coroutines.
